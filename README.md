# Global Development Indicators: A Statistical Analysis for Corruption Control

## Project Overview

This project, completed as part of a course on Linear Models, investigates global development indicators and their relationship with corruption control through statistical analysis.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Examination**: Analyze data from various countries, focusing on global development indicators.
- **Variable Categorization**: Classify data into qualitative and quantitative variables.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute averages, variances, and other descriptive statistics.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Develop a multiple linear regression model to explore relationships between variables.
- **Model Validation**: Verify model assumptions to ensure robustness.
- **ANOVA**: Conduct Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to assess differences in means between dependent and independent variables.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and categorize data into appropriate qualitative and quantitative types.
2. **Descriptive Analysis**: Calculate key statistical measures including means, variances, and other relevant statistics.
3. **Model Building**: Create a multiple linear regression model to explore the relationships between indicators and corruption control.
4. **Assumption Testing**: Validate the assumptions of the linear model to ensure accuracy.
5. **ANOVA Testing**: Perform ANOVA to evaluate differences in means across different variables.

## Results and Findings

The results of this analysis will include:

- Summary statistics of the indicators
- Details of the multiple linear regression model
- Validation of model assumptions
- ANOVA results highlighting differences in means
